This is a project from the course "System programming" I have taken in my second year in Ben Gurion University.
It is a collaboration with Tsuri Farhana, we both contributed for this project.
The main goal was to practice using database with our application.
This project is about managing the logistics of providing the covid-19 vaccinces.
